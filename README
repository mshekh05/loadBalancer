Certainly! Here's how you can design an ETL system on AWS without using AWS Glue:

Assumptions:

Data Source: Assume we have multiple data sources including Amazon RDS, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon S3.
Data Volume: Assume we need to process terabytes of data daily.
Real-Time vs. Batch: Assume we need to support both real-time and batch data processing using AWS services.
Transformations: Assume we need to perform various transformations such as filtering, aggregations, joins, and enrichments on the data using AWS services.
Scalability: Assume the system should be able to scale horizontally to handle increasing data volumes using AWS services.
Fault Tolerance: Assume the system should be fault-tolerant and resilient to failures at various levels using AWS services.
Security: Assume the system should ensure data security and privacy during processing and storage using AWS services.
Monitoring and Logging: Assume the system should provide comprehensive monitoring and logging capabilities for tracking data flow, performance metrics, and errors using AWS services.
Cost Optimization: Assume cost optimization is a key consideration, and the system should utilize AWS resources efficiently.
Question for the Interviewee:
Design a robust ETL system on AWS capable of handling the assumptions mentioned above without using AWS Glue. Consider all AWS services necessary for extracting, transforming, and loading data efficiently while meeting the required scalability, fault tolerance, security, and monitoring requirements.

Possible Components to Include:

Data Extraction Layer:

Utilize AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) for extracting data from Amazon RDS and Amazon DynamoDB.
Use AWS Lambda functions triggered by events from data sources for real-time data extraction.
Implement custom scripts or use AWS SDKs to fetch data from Amazon S3.
Data Transformation Layer:

Utilize Amazon EC2 instances or AWS Lambda functions for performing data transformations using custom code.
Design modular and reusable transformation logic to handle diverse data formats and schemas.
Implement distributed processing using frameworks like Apache Spark or Hadoop on Amazon EMR if required.
Data Loading Layer:

Use Amazon S3 as a data lake for storing intermediate and final data.
Utilize AWS Data Pipeline or custom scripts running on EC2 instances to load transformed data into target data warehouses such as Amazon Redshift or Amazon Athena.
Orchestration and Workflow Management:

Use AWS Step Functions or AWS Lambda for orchestrating ETL workflows and coordinating dependencies between different stages.
Design state machines to handle retries, error handling, and workflow scheduling.
Scalability and Resource Management:

Deploy ETL jobs on scalable Amazon EC2 instances or serverless AWS Lambda functions to handle varying workloads.
Utilize Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling for managing compute resources efficiently based on demand.
Security and Data Privacy:

Implement encryption using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for data in transit and at rest.
Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for access controls and authentication.
Monitoring and Logging:

Integrate Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring ETL job executions, performance metrics, and logs.
Configure CloudWatch Alarms to trigger alerts for anomalies, errors, and performance issues.
Testing and Quality Assurance:

Implement AWS CloudFormation for infrastructure as code, enabling automated deployment and testing of ETL pipelines.
Utilize AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeBuild for continuous integration and deployment of ETL code changes.
Conclusion:
The interviewee's design should leverage various AWS services to address each aspect of the ETL system, considering the provided assumptions and requirements. A well-architected ETL system on AWS without using Glue should be scalable, fault-tolerant, secure, cost-effective, and equipped with comprehensive monitoring and logging capabilities to ensure efficient data processing.

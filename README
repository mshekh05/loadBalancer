Certainly! Here's a list of questions and potential answers for an architecture and system design interview for an AWS developer:

1. **What is AWS and what are its core services?**
   
   *Answer:* 
   AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a cloud computing platform offered by Amazon. Its core services include:
   - Compute (EC2, Lambda)
   - Storage (S3, EBS)
   - Databases (RDS, DynamoDB)
   - Networking (VPC, Route 53)
   - Content Delivery and CDN (CloudFront)
   - Management Tools (CloudWatch, CloudFormation)

2. **Explain the concept of Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) in AWS and its types.**

   *Answer:* 
   ELB automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses. Types of ELB:
   - Application Load Balancer (ALB): Routes HTTP/HTTPS traffic based on content.
   - Network Load Balancer (NLB): Handles TCP traffic at the connection level.
   - Classic Load Balancer (CLB): Legacy load balancer for EC2-Classic instances.

3. **How would you design a fault-tolerant architecture using AWS services?**

   *Answer:* 
   A fault-tolerant architecture in AWS involves:
   - Deploying resources across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for redundancy.
   - Using Auto Scaling Groups to replace failed instances automatically.
   - Leveraging AWS services like Elastic Load Balancers and Route 53 for load balancing and DNS failover.
   - Utilizing multi-region setups for disaster recovery.

4. **Explain the differences between scaling vertically and horizontally. When would you choose one over the other?**

   *Answer:* 
   - Vertical scaling involves increasing the resources of a single instance (e.g., upgrading CPU, RAM), while horizontal scaling involves adding more instances.
   - Vertical scaling is simpler but has limits, while horizontal scaling is more scalable but may require more complex setup.
   - Vertical scaling may be suitable for applications with predictable growth or limited budget, while horizontal scaling is preferable for highly scalable and dynamic workloads.

5. **Describe the use cases and benefits of using AWS Lambda.**

   *Answer:* 
   - Use cases: Event-driven applications, real-time file processing, automation tasks, etc.
   - Benefits: No server management, automatic scaling, cost-effective pricing model (pay-per-execution), seamless integration with other AWS services.

6. **How would you implement data backup and disaster recovery in AWS?**

   *Answer:* 
   - Use AWS services like Amazon S3 for data backup and Amazon Glacier for long-term archival.
   - Implement cross-region replication in S3 for disaster recovery.
   - Use AWS Backup service for centralized backup management and automation.

   *Answer:* 
   - Amazon RDS is a managed relational database service, while Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service.
   - Choose Amazon RDS for relational data and complex queries requiring SQL support. Choose DynamoDB for high scalability, fast performance, and flexible schema requirements.

8. **How do you secure data in transit and at rest in AWS?**

   *Answer:* 
   - Secure data in transit using SSL/TLS for encryption (e.g., HTTPS, SSL on RDS).
   - Secure data at rest using encryption services like AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for managing encryption keys and services like S3 SSE (Server-Side Encryption) and EBS encryption.

9. **Explain the difference between Amazon EC2 and AWS Lambda. When would you use one over the other?**

   *Answer:* 
   - Amazon EC2 provides resizable compute capacity in the form of virtual servers (instances), where you manage the servers. AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service where you upload your code and it automatically runs in response to events.
   - Use EC2 for applications with predictable workloads or long-running tasks. Use Lambda for event-driven, short-lived tasks with sporadic or unpredictable execution patterns.

10. **How would you design a highly available and scalable web application architecture on AWS?**

    *Answer:* 
    - Utilize multiple Availability Zones for redundancy.
    - Use Auto Scaling Groups for automatic scaling based on demand.
    - Employ Elastic Load Balancers for distributing traffic.
    - Implement caching with services like Amazon ElastiCache or Amazon CloudFront.
    - Use managed database services like Amazon RDS or Amazon DynamoDB for reliability and scalability.
    - Implement health checks and monitoring with Amazon CloudWatch for proactive issue detection and resolution.

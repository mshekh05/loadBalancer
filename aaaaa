 Group And Concatenate With Formulas And Filter Function
In Excel, you can apply formulas to concatenated rows based on one column, then use the Filter function to display the result only.

Note: You need to sort your data by the class before following steps.

In the formula, A13 is the first data in the “Class” column, B13 is the first data in the “Name” column, “,” is the separator to delimit concatenate contents.

2. Then in the next column, D13, type this formula =IF(A13<>A14,"Last","") , and drag fill handle down to apply the formula to cells you need.
